The stuff on this branch is a recent refactoring attempt I've decided to undertake after realising this thing actually kinda works. I'm only keeping the JS/CSS/HTML here, no audio files.

The stuff on gh-pages is the original version. It's a fully functional website (with many issues, as outlined in the readme) but I'm not going to continue maintaining it, for reasons that become obvious if you look at the code. It'll do as a prototype for now though.
